This set of 690 images includes all the trials for the VHPT-no (either with Ziggerins, Greebles or Sheinbugs), including practice trials. You can use them to program in any software you would like, but the order should stay the same (following the trial numbers).

The images are labeled for our own in-house software, but it provides you the information needed to program the trials yourself.

Namely:

Isi-1000_limit-1000 means that the image is shown with an interstimulus interval of 1000 ms, and for 1000 ms after which it disappears.
Section-3 means that the screen is split in 3 equal horizontal sections to collect responses, and “correct-1”, “-2” or “-3” indicates which answer is correct on this particular trial. The three choices are shown until a response is given. Feedback (correct or incorrect) is provided only for practice trials.

The tests have a fixed order of trials, as is common for many individual differences measures, so that variability associated with order is not confounded with subject variability.

A spreadsheet is included that shows the coding of each trial in terms of alignment, congruency, the part that is relevant and the location (correct answer).
